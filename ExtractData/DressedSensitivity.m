% Perhaps this can be added to the spectrum.

%this could be done with the help of programmer gnomes that do all the

%In the docuement titeled Dressed Spin Optimization they find the existance
%of an optimum theta and then show that based on the existance of an optimum theta value
%pulsed dressing is the superior method due to the longer time spent at
%this optimum value. 

%Clearly must be true. However, they neglected relaxation
% Given that modluation has been successfully 
%demonstrated via campaign of spin dressing simulations, and has shown to
%have very little theta deviations due to the high frequency oscillations
%that the dressing provides, apparetly it is the case that the spins follow
%one another around on the dressed path. Therefore we would expect any
%generated would be due to the rising background rate of the depolarized
%fraction. (that is the transverse rate). 

%in that study they propose that further analysis is requried to decide on
%a final spin dressing proposed 
%this is an attempt to push in that direciton. 
% I will attempt to write a simple code that can be used to estimate the
% efficieny of a pulse modulation type to calculate the ultame single cell
% single run sensitivity. 

%therefore it is prudent to include relaxation (noise) due to nonuniformities. 
%and the phi_b rate. this is a
%constant background rate that will be included, this is due to vince's
%concern of a largeer than mayb eexpected background rate due to neutrons
%hitting all the stuff in our experiment. 

%we can include rms nonuniforminities as an additional noise source, this
%is included as phi_b. furthermore we can correlate the thingy mo bobber.
%er whatever by doing mathy stuff.
%we cross-correlate the signal with the modluation, this can be done by the
%fukcing factor that brad's analysis came up with. This is the base, then
%we add we perform the integration with the
%modulation which is equivieleint to series of delta phunctions the delta
